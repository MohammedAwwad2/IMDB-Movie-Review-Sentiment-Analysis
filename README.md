Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. The goal is to automatically classify each review as positive or negative based on the text content.

What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify and extract opinions or emotions from text. In this case, it determines whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative opinion.

Dataset
The project uses the IMDb movie review dataset, which contains thousands of movie reviews labeled with their sentiment (positive or negative). This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.
